  abstract = {During a course on computer architecture, assembler, C programming, network and communication, 57 out of 300 students were followed closely by questionnaires and tests in order to evaluate their learning of computer architecture. The results indicate both that the students' understanding of logic gates and Boolean algebra is poorer than preferred, and that the students also have difficulties grasping the implementation of higher level constructs in low level architecture features. Better results might have been achieved if the teaching of architecture was closely linked to the students' previous training in programming.},
